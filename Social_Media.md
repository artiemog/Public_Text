<sup>1</sup>I was previously active on Freenode, but I disconnected permanently on 14 June 2021, and Freenode has since purged their nick registrations.  If you see an artiemog on Freenode, it isn't me.

<sup>2</sup>I was previously active on Furnet, but I no longer am.  I did not deregister my nick, but it may have expired by now.

## Video Streaming Services
Don't expect any content on these accounts; I just use them to watch and chat
in others' streams.
